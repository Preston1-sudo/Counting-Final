# Counting-Final

The purpose of this repository is to submit my final where I am tasked to create a bash script that displays a list of number starting from 1 and ends at 50 in a numerical order.

I had originally named the script file "1 to 50" but it would only display the first character since I did not use underscores to space the numbers and words.

The new name for the file is "counting_script".

Below is how to make sure the file is downloaded and how to exexcute the script.

Type "ls -l" to view and make sure the file was indeed downloaded.

Type "./counting_script.sh" and then press enter.

A list should appear that displays the 50 number list in order.
