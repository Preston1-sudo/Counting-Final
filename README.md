# Counting-Final

The purpose of this repository is to show what I have learned and can create a bash script that will display a list of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 50.

Below is how to make sure the file is downloaded and how to run the script to achieve the desired result of the script.

Type "ls -l" to view and make sure the file was indeed downloaded.

Type "./counting_script.sh" and then press enter.

A list should appear that displays the 50 number list in numerical order.

If everyhting went perfectly, a list of numbers in order should appear.
